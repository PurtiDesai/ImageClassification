<h2> Trained a YOLOV8 object detection model for face detection using the dataset provided. </h2>
<h2> Then trained an Image classification model which takes the input as a crop from the object detection model (facecrop) to classify emotions in categories [‘Happy’, ‘Sad’, ‘Neutral’] and displays the class name on the face class bounding box on 4 videos.</h2>
